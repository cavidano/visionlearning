            We provide resources for educators to integrate the process of science into their teaching. This freely available, high-quality science content is designed to be used in a variety of settings, from the traditional classroom to a distance learning course to the kitchen table. We strive to make these materials accessible to the broadest possible audience.

            Our Classroom is a customizable environment dedicated to the content available on the website. Here educators can create personalized classrooms with specific course modules, make comments directly in these modules, store lesson plans and notes within the system, and track student progress. The customizable nature of this system is particularly useful for those instructors leading interdisciplinary courses, where no one textbook exists.
