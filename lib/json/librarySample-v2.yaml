  Description: >
    Life as we know it is a wonderfully diverse enterprise. Organisms pass
    traits from parent to offspring, function in a varied and changing
    environment, and carry out a myriad of complex biochemical processes.
    Understanding the principles of biology helps give context and clarity to
    larger scientific and social issues. Our biology learning modules reveal the
    current state of scientific understanding on topics like cell structure and
    function, genetics, taxonomy, evolution by natural selection, and more.
