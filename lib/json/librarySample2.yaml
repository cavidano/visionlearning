      - Id: '251'
        Name: Kinetic-Molecular Theory
        Summary: >
          Over four hundred years, scientists including Rudolf Clausius and James
          Clerk Maxwell developed the kinetic-molecular theory (KMT) of gases,
          which describes how molecule properties relate to the macroscopic
          behaviors of an ideal gas—a theoretical gas that always obeys the ideal
          gas equation. KMT provides assumptions about molecule behavior that can
          be used both as the basis for other theories about molecules and to
          solve real-world problems.

        Name: Chemical Bonding
        Summary: >
          The millions of different chemical compounds that make up everything on
          Earth are composed of 118 elements that bond together in different ways.
          This module explores two common types of chemical bonds: covalent and
          ionic. The module presents chemical bonding on a sliding scale from pure
          covalent to pure ionic, depending on differences in the
          electronegativity of the bonding atoms. Highlights from three centuries
          of scientific inquiry into chemical bonding include Isaac Newton’s
          ‘forces’, Gilbert Lewis’s dot structures, and Linus Pauling’s
          application of the principles of quantum mechanics.
      - Id: '268'
        Summary: >
          Chemical equations are an efficient way to describe chemical reactions.
          This module explains the shorthand notation used to express how atoms
          are rearranged to make new compounds during a chemical reaction. It
          shows how balanced chemical equations convey proportions of each
          reactant and product involved. The module traces the development of
          chemical equations over the past four centuries as our understanding of
          chemical processes grew. A look at chemical equations reveals that
          nothing is lost and nothing is gained in a typical chemical
          reaction–matter simply changes form.

- Name: Math in Science
  Description: >
    The German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss referred to mathematics as the
    "Queen of the Sciences". In doing so, Gauss not only identified Math as a
    science itself in that it is defined as the study of numbers and their
    operations, but also as the underlying foundation for all other sciences 
    allowing scientists to describe patterns in data, relationships between
    variables, and fundamental principles discovered in our quest for knowledge.
    From the study of a wave, which can be described by its length, height, and
    frequency, to the measurement of the rate at which the tectonic plates in
    the earth's crust are moving, mathematical principles are fundamental to
    understanding and doing science. Our Math in Science modules discuss select
    mathematical principles in context of their use across different scientific
    disciplines, focusing explicitly on how these principles are used in

        In almost every facet of modern life, values – measurements – play an
        important role. We count calories for a diet, stores measure the
        percentage of tax on our purchases, and our doctors measure important
        physiological indicators, like heart rate and blood pressure. From the
        earliest documented days in ancient Egypt, systems of measurement have
        allowed us to weigh and count objects, delineate boundaries, mark time,
        establish currencies, and describe natural phenomena. Yet, measurement
        comes with its own series of challenges. From human error and accidents
        in measuring to variability to the simply unknowable, even the most

  Description: >
    When Buzz Aldrin joined Neil Armstrong on the moon in 1969, one of the first
    things he did was to try one-footed kangaroo hops. Why? To test out methods
    for moving around in lunar gravity (which is 1/6th that of Earth's). Aldrin
    was experimenting with physics, a discipline that involves the study of
    matter and forces and how they interact in space and time. The modules
    contained in our Physics Library explore the properties of light,
    electromagnetism, gravity, and more.

- Name: Process of Science
  Description: >
    What is it about a scientific theory that sets it apart from other ideas?
    How does one conduct and control a scientific experiment? Why do statistical
    statements weigh so heavily in science? Scientists often talk about the
    findings of their research, but they are less likely to talk about the
    processes and methods that lead to those discoveries. Yet these processes
    and methods, and the surprises scientists face while pursuing them define
    science. Our process of science modules use in-depth examples to introduce
    the methods used by scientists, the ways that scientists work with data and
    communicate their findings, and the culture and diversity of science.
