                            The deepest places on Earth are in South Africa, where mining companies have excavated 3.5 km into Earth to extract gold. No one has seen deeper into Earth than the South African miners because the heat and pressure felt at these depths prevents humans from going much deeper. Yet Earth's radius is 6,370 km – how do we begin to know what is below the thin skin of the Earth when we cannot see it?

                            In his landmark book Micrographia, Hooke called these spaces "cells"
                            because they resembled the small rooms monks
                            lived in (cella in Latin). What Hooke’s samples were not able to reveal
                            at the time, though, was that cells are not
                            in fact empty. Though he was diligent in looking at his samples through
                            different magnifications and with various
                            light sources and angles, there were two major obstacles that stood in
                            Hooke’s way of discovering subcellular
                            structures. The first was that the microscope he was using at the time
                            was still too low of a magnification to show
                            that much was contained within the walls of the cells. The second: His
                            samples were of cork – composed of long-dead
                            cells, absent of any cytosol or organelles.

                            Evidence about Earth's interior
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Isaac Newton was one of the first scientists to theorize about the structure of Earth. <span class="cool">Based on his studies of the force of gravity, Newton calculated the average density of Earth and found it to be more than twice the density of the rocks near the surface.</span> From these results, Newton realized that the interior of Earth had to be much denser than the surface rocks. His findings excluded the possibility of a cavernous, fiery underworld inhabited by the dead, but still left many questions unanswered. Where does the denser material begin? How does the composition differ from surface rocks?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Volcanic vents like Shiprock occasionally bring up pieces of Earth from as deep as 150 km, but these rocks are rare, and we have little hope of taking Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. Instead, much of our knowledge about the internal structure of the Earth comes from remote observations – specifically, from observations of earthquakes.

                Did you know that although earthquakes can be very destructive, they provide a wealth
                of information about Earth's interior? Miners, geologists, and others have always
                wondered what lies below the surface of Earth, but heat and pressure make it
                impossible to explore deep into its interior. However, seismic waves produced by
                earthquakes reveal the structure and composition of our planet.

              Hooke, Robert
            </h2>
			<p>
                [person] An English physicist, born on the Isle of Wight (1635-1703). Hooke's studies were extremely diverse, encompassing biology, geology, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. He was also an accomplished inventor: He designed the universal joint, the iris diaphragm, a prototype of a respirator, and the balance spring. In 1662, he became the first Curator of Experiments for the Royal Society of London. Hooke discovered the theory for combustion and devised an equation for elasticity, which is now known as Hooke's Law. He also made important contributions in biology by describing and naming cells, which he observed with a compound microscope that he designed.
