                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    There are many discoveries that have changed the course of science and
                    the world. Nikola Tesla’s discovery of alternating currents, for
                    example, helped pave the way for widespread access to electricity, and
                    Louis Pasteur’s discovery that heat and disinfectant could kill bacteria
                    improved food safety and saved millions of lives. In 1655, the English
                    scientist Robert Hooke made an observation that would change the study
                    of biology forever. While examining a thin, dried section of cork tree
                    with a crude light microscope, Hooke observed that he could plainly see
                    the cork to be made up of tiny spaces surrounded by walls, much like a
                    honeycomb, but that the spaces were irregular and shallow (Figure 1).
                    Further, Hooke noted that these "little Boxes" were so numerous that
                    there were "in a square Inch above a Million... and in a Cubick Inch,
                    above twelve hundred Millions [sic]" (Hooke, 1655).

                    In his landmark book Micrographia, Hooke called these spaces "cells"
                    because they resembled the small rooms monks
                    lived in (cella in Latin). What Hooke’s samples were not able to reveal
                    at the time, though, was that cells are not
                    in fact empty. Though he was diligent in looking at his samples through
                    different magnifications and with various
                    light sources and angles, there were two major obstacles that stood in
                    Hooke’s way of discovering subcellular
                    structures. The first was that the microscope he was using at the time
                    was still too low of a magnification to show
                    that much was contained within the walls of the cells. The second: His
                    samples were of cork – composed of long-dead
                    cells, absent of any cytosol or organelles.

                    Antony van Leeuwenhoek improves microscopy
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In the years immediately following, other scientists would build on the work of Hooke,
                    including Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632 – 1723), a cloth merchant in Delft, Nederland.
                    Van Leeuwenhoek was not a scientist by formal training, but he was an industrious and
                    curious individual who took great joy in observing the world around him (Anderson,
                    2009). While working in his haberdashery in the 1670s, van Leeuwenhoek began to
                    experiment with glass-blowing and the construction of microscopes (Figure 2). Using the
                    designs described by Hooke in Micrographia, van Leeuwenhoek built his own microscopes by
                    hand, fabricating every element from the highly-refined lens to the screws used to hold
                    the instrument together (Anderson, 2009).

                    During his lifetime, van Leeuwenhoek constructed hundreds of microscopes and lenses by
                    hand, each one unique. It was with these microscopes and improved lenses that he began
                    to study the world around him and share these observations with institutions like the
                    English Royal Society. One of his first important observations came in August 1674, when
                    he looked at water samples from Berkelse Meer, a lake two miles outside of Delft. In a
                    letter to Henry Oldenburg that September, and published in Philosophical Transactions of
                    the Royal Society, van Leeuwenhoek noted:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>I took up some of it [the water] in a Glass-vessel which having viewed the next day,
                        I found moving in it several Earthy particles, and some green streaks, spirally
                        ranged, ... among all of which there crawled abundance of little animals some of
                        which were roundish; those that were somewhat bigger than others were of an Oval
                        figure: On these latter I saw two legs near the head and two little fins on the
                        other end of their body…. The motion of most of them in the water was so swift, and
                        so various, upwards, downwards, and round about, that I confess I could not but
                        wonder at it. I judge, that some of these little creatures were above a thousand
                        times smaller than the smallest ones, which I have hitherto seen.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    What van Leeuwenhoek was seeing, we can now presume, were some of the smallest forms of
                    life: protozoa, rotifers, ciliates, and phytoplankton. Van Leeuwenhoek’s descriptions
                    are among the first to identify the unique features of these different microscopic
                    organisms and was the beginning of the discipline we now call microbiology – the study
                    of microscopic organisms.

                    In the years immediately following van Leeuwenhoek’s discovery of microorganisms in the
                    Berkelse Meer water, his studies unearthed some very important cellular distinctions.
                    Among them was the discovery of single-celled organisms (Figure 3) and structures
                    existing within the walls of Hooke’s originally-thought-empty plant cells (large
                    organelles called vacuoles).

                <h2>
                    The beginnings of cell theory
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Science is not a solitary endeavor, and many important “Aha!” moments have been the
                    result of being in the right place at the right time. Such was the case with the
                    development of cell theory. During a dinner conversation in 1838, German botanist
                    Matthias Jacob Schleiden mentioned to the German physiologist Theodore Schwann that he
                    believed all plants, and plant parts, were composed of cells. Schwann had come to a
                    similar conclusion about animals through his own research and immediately saw the value
                    in sharing such an idea publicly in the scientific sector (and sharing it quickly,
                    before someone else got credit for it). In 1839, his work Microscopic Investigations on
                    the Accordance in the Structure and Growth of Plants and Animals was published and,
                    without giving any credit to Schleiden, formally made the first statement in cell
                    theory: All living things are composed of cells and cell products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simple statement was another important turning point in biology. At the time of the
                    book’s publication, Schwann was working in the laboratory of Johannes Peter Müller at
                    the University of Berlin. In a true symbiotic relationship, Müller used his leverage as
                    the University’s Chair of the Anatomy and Physiology Department to promote the text;
                    Schwann continued to work in the laboratory and helped solidify Müller’s lab as the
                    research center of cell theory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The belief that all living things are composed of cells was soon widely accepted in the
                    scientific community, but how these cells came into being was still an area of
                    unknowing. In the heavily religious atmosphere of the 18th and 19th centuries, any
                    suggestion that life was the result of something other than a Divine Creation was met
                    with great resistance. So most scientists of the time subscribed to the Theory of
                    Spontaneous Generation while they continued to research the structure and function of
                    life (see our Experimentation in Scientific Research module).
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the quality and magnification ability of microscopes continued to improve, the
                    discoveries about the diversity of cells and cell structures also increased. It wasn't long
                    before it was clear that there were two major types of cells – those that are an organism
                    unto themselves (unicellular), and those that are most often part of a larger body
                    (multicellular). Further, within these two types it was noticed that some had a
                    membrane-bound nucleus, and some did not. These two major types were given the names
                    prokaryote (meaning, "before the nut" or "kernel") and eukaryote (meaning, "with the nut" or
                    "kernel"). The "nut" or "kernel" refers to the nucleus (Figure 4).

                                            Sorry, that is incorrect. Metamorphism involves deep burial combined with high temperature and pressure. In the photo, the rocks have been uplifted and the overlying material is being removed. Which choice names the wearing-away process we see in the photograph?

                                            Correct! Rocks that form below Earth’s surface must be uplifted. Then the overlying material must be removed through erosion in order for the rocks to be exposed. This wearing-away process can happen by the action of water, wind, or glacial ice.

                    Prokaryotes and eukaryotes: The case for a shared ancestry
                </h2>
                <p>
                    While all life is made up of cells, not all cells have the same structure. In the organization
                    of living things, organisms fall into one of two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Prokaryotes
                    (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotes (fungi, plants, animals, and protists) have many defining
                    factors that are different from one another, but their similarities are very important and form
                    the foundation on which a theory of shared ancestry is built.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All prokaryotes and eukaryotes consist of cytosol with ribosomes suspended in it, the genetic
                    material of DNA and RNA, and are enclosed in a membrane. These common elements are chemically
                    and structurally almost indistinguishable. The plasma membrane consists of a phospholipid
                    bilayer, which is a fatty film that surrounds the cell (see our Membranes I: Introduction to
                    Biological Membranes module to learn more). This membrane contains several structures that allow
                    the cell to perform necessary tasks, including pumps and channels that allow substances to move
                    into and out of the cell, and receptors that allow the cell to sense what is in its surroundings
                    and be recognized by other cells (see our Membranes II: Passive and Active Transporters module).
                    This plasma membrane forms a semi-permeable barrier that keeps the cell’s cytosol from leaking
                    out and the surrounding environment from leaking in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cytosol is a gel-like fluid consisting of water packed with dissolved nutrients, wastes, ions,
                    proteins, enzymes, and many other molecules. Many chemical reactions take place in the cytosol
                    and it contains particles and filaments that provide shape to cells. Suspended within the
                    cytosol are ribosomes – large molecular machines responsible for translating the information
                    contained in RNA into proteins. The number of ribosomes in a cell depends largely on the cell’s
                    function. (See Figures 5 and 6 for illustrations of the cell structures.)

                The human body consists of trillions of individual cells and 200 distinct types of
                cells? Human cells range in size from 1/12,000 of an inch (a few micrometers) to
                over 39 inches (more than a meter) long. All living things are made of cells, but in
                spite of vast differences in size, shape, and function, these building blocks of
                life share remarkable similarities.
