                        <p>
                            There are many discoveries that have changed the course of science and
                            the world. Nikola Tesla’s discovery of alternating currents, for
                            example, helped pave the way for widespread access to electricity, and
                            Louis Pasteur’s discovery that heat and disinfectant could kill bacteria
                            improved food safety and saved millions of lives. In 1655, the English
                            scientist Robert Hooke made an observation that would change the study
                            of biology forever. While examining a thin, dried section of cork tree
                            with a crude light microscope, Hooke observed that he could plainly see
                            the cork to be made up of tiny spaces surrounded by walls, much like a
                            honeycomb, but that the spaces were irregular and shallow (Figure 1).
                            Further, Hooke noted that these "little Boxes" were so numerous that
                            there were "in a square Inch above a Million... and in a Cubick Inch,
                            above twelve hundred Millions [sic]" (Hooke, 1655).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In his landmark book Micrographia, Hooke called these spaces "cells"
                            because they resembled the small rooms monks
                            lived in (cella in Latin). What Hooke’s samples were not able to reveal
                            at the time, though, was that cells are not
                            in fact empty. Though he was diligent in looking at his samples through
                            different magnifications and with various
                            light sources and angles, there were two major obstacles that stood in
                            Hooke’s way of discovering subcellular
                            structures. The first was that the microscope he was using at the time
                            was still too low of a magnification to show
                            that much was contained within the walls of the cells. The second: His
                            samples were of cork – composed of long-dead
                            cells, absent of any cytosol or organelles.

                The human body consists of trillions of individual cells and 200 distinct types of
                cells? Human cells range in size from 1/12,000 of an inch (a few micrometers) to
                over 39 inches (more than a meter) long. All living things are made of cells, but in
                spite of vast differences in size, shape, and function, these building blocks of
                life share remarkable similarities.
