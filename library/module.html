                                                There are many discoveries that have changed the course of science and
                                                the world. Nikola Tesla’s discovery of alternating currents, for
                                                example, helped pave the way for widespread access to electricity, and
                                                Louis Pasteur’s discovery that heat and disinfectant could kill bacteria
                                                improved food safety and saved millions of lives. In 1655, the English
                                                scientist Robert Hooke made an observation that would change the study
                                                of biology forever. While examining a thin, dried section of cork tree
                                                with a crude light microscope, Hooke observed that he could plainly see
                                                the cork to be made up of tiny spaces surrounded by walls, much like a
                                                honeycomb, but that the spaces were irregular and shallow (Figure 1).
                                                Further, Hooke noted that these "little Boxes" were so numerous that
                                                there were "in a square Inch above a Million... and in a Cubick Inch,
                                                above twelve hundred Millions [sic]" (Hooke, 1655).

                                            <p>
                                                In his landmark book Micrographia, Hooke called these spaces "cells"
                                                because they resembled the small rooms monks
                                                lived in (cella in Latin). What Hooke’s samples were not able to reveal
                                                at the time, though, was that cells are not
                                                in fact empty. Though he was diligent in looking at his samples through
                                                different magnifications and with various
                                                light sources and angles, there were two major obstacles that stood in
                                                Hooke’s way of discovering subcellular
                                                structures. The first was that the microscope he was using at the time
                                                was still too low of a magnification to show
                                                that much was contained within the walls of the cells. The second: His
                                                samples were of cork – composed of long-dead
                                                cells, absent of any cytosol or organelles.
