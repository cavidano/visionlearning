We've made enhancements to the <a class="link-new-window" href="{{ site.url }}/docs/audio/"><span class="link__text">Interactive Animations</span></a> in-module CTA. The mobile view has been optimized for a better user experience. Additionally, a new accessible window icon has been added, informing users that clicking will open the content in a new window.
