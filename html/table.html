                    <p>27 May 2007<br>Dear Authors:</p>
                    <p>I have received two reviews of your manuscript entitled "Quantifying the effect of humic matter on the suppression of mercury emissions from artificial soil surfaces" submitted for publication in
                        <em>Applied Geochemistry</em>. In addition I have read your paper and have some additional comments that are below. All reviewers including myself agree the paper after revisions is acceptable for publication.</p>
                    <p>I have attached both reviewers' comments to this email.  Both reviewers raise some important issues that need to be clearly addressed in your revised paper. I agree with their concerns and below have added a few others that need to be addressed.</p>
                    <p>Sincerely,<br>Editor for Special Issue of
                        <em>Applied Geochemistry</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Additional detailed comments from the Editor:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The mass balance needs to be considered [as detailed by reviewer 2]. My guess is your flow rate is producing an artificially high flux. The way to deal with this would be to use the actual concentration difference between the inlet and outlet instead of the flux to calculate the amount lost. Plot the difference between the outlet and inlet concentrations rather than flux.</p>
                    <p></p>
