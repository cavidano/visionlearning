                            Visual Annotations to Support the Use of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) with our Educational Modules
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Our new annotation feature allows teachers and students to see the connections between our educational modules and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Our latest update introduces color-coded annotations, allowing users to easily visualize and navigate content related to the three dimensions of the NGSS within each module. This innovative feature can be toggled on and off within the right sidebar of each module, providing a customizable learning experience tailored to individual needs.

                        <p>
                            To make the annotations easily distinguishable, we have assigned distinct colors to each NGSS dimension that match the published color scheme:

These lessons are written by professional scientists and educators who ensure that they are accurate and concise to avoid overloading students with extraneous information. At the top of each lesson is a <strong>pre-reader</strong>, which contains questions to stimulate prior knowledge on the topic, a general overview of what the module will cover, and some definitions of terms users should understand before reading. A <strong>table of contents</strong> provides an outline of the entire module.

                                    <strong>Audio recordings</strong> of the module can be streamed while on the page. These audio files help aural learners, struggling readers, and language learners by modeling intonation, inflection, and pronunciation of difficult terms and names. Audio is also provided in both English and Spanish.

                                    <strong>Glossary terms</strong> in the lesson are hyperlinked to a pop-up glossary to allow easy access to unfamiliar definitions. Hovering over the term provides a quick, on-screen definition. Clicking the term opens a lightbox with additional information (including an audio pronunciation), and the glossary page for the term provides even more.

                                    <strong>Comprehension Checkpoints</strong> are questions placed in strategic spots throughout each module to promote good reading techniques. These checkpoints ask the reader a specific question related to the content immediately preceding, helping them to stop and think about what they have just read. Immediate feedback helps them know if they need to re-read, or if they have understood a concept correctly.

                            Because interaction helps to focus students' attention, most of our lessons contain <strong>interactive learning tools</strong> embedded within the body of the lesson. These animations help illustrate points and concepts addressed in the reading.
