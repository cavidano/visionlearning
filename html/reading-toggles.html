									Evidence about Earth's interior

									<mark class="term" data-term-def="[person] English alchemist, physicist, astronomer and mathematician born in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, Lincolnshire (1643-1727). In 1672, Newton offered an experimental proof that light is composed of pmodules, and developed a theory of color based on the separation of white light through a prism. This theory was broadly (though not universally) accepted until the 18th century. In 1687, he published the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which many considered the most influential book in the history of science. In it, Newton presents his theories of universal gravitation and the laws of motion. He is credited, along with Gottfried Leibniz, for the development of calculus, and he demonstrated a consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravity, dispelling the final doubts in the scientific community over a heliocentric view of the solar system. He also contributed significantly to the development of new technology, inventing the reflecting telescope." tabindex="2">Isaac Newton</mark> was one of the first scientists to theorize about the structure of Earth. <mark class="ngss" data-ngss-cat-abbr="Practice" data-ngss-cat-full="Science and Engineering Practices" data-ngss-desc="Using mathematics and computational thinking: Newton used a quantitative relationship between physical variables to make a prediction about Earth.">Based on his studies of the <mark class="term" data-term-def="[noun] An influence (a 'push or pull') that changes the motion of a moving object (e.g., slows it down, speeds it up, changes its direction) or produces motion in a stationary object.

									Volcanic vents like Shiprock occasionally bring up pieces of Earth from as deep as 150 km, but these rocks are rare, and we have little hope of taking Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. Instead, much of our knowledge about the internal structure of the Earth comes from remote observations – specifically, from observations of earthquakes.
								</p>

								<p>
									Earthquakes can be extremely destructive for humans, but they provide a wealth of information about Earth's interior. <mark class="ngss" data-ngss-cat-abbr="Crosscutting" data-ngss-cat-full="Crosscutting Concepts" data-ngss-desc="PS4.A Grades 9-12: Geologists use seismic waves and their reflections at interfaces between layers to probe structures deep in the planet."> This is because every earthquake sends out an array of seismic waves in all directions, similar to the way that throwing a stone into a pond sends out waves through the water. Observing the behavior of these seismic waves as they travel through the Earth gives us insight into the materials the waves move through</mark>.

The distinction between these two <mark class="term" data-term-def="[noun] The motion of rising and falling in curves; undulation." tabindex="11">waves</mark>
									is easy to picture with a stretched-out Slinky®. If you push on one end, a compression wave passes through the Slinky® parallel to its length (see P-waves video). If instead you move one end up and down rapidly, a "ripple" wave moves through the Slinky® (see S-waves video). The compression waves are P-waves, and the ripple waves are S-waves.

								</p>

								<p>
									Given Newton's observations, if we assume Earth's density increases evenly with depth because of the overlying pressure, wave velocity will also increase with depth and the waves will continuously refract, traveling along curved paths back towards the surface. Figure 1 shows the kind of pattern we would expect to see in this case. By the early 1900s, when seismographs were installed worldwide, it quickly became clear that Earth could not possibly be so simple.
								</p>

								<p>
									As early as 132 CE, the Chinese had built instruments to measure the ground shaking associated with earthquakes.

									It wasn't long before those seismologists recognized that they were also recording earthquakes occurring thousands of kilometers away.
