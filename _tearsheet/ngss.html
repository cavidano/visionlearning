                        Isaac Newton was one of the first scientists to theorize about the structure of Earth. <mark class="ngss practices">Based on his studies of the force of gravity, Newton calculated the average density of Earth and found it to be more than twice the density of the rocks near the surface.</mark><mark class="ngss practices">From these results, Newton realized that the interior of Earth had to be much denser than the surface rocks.</mark> His findings excluded the possibility of a cavernous, fiery underworld inhabited by the dead, but still left many questions unanswered. <mark class="ngss practices">Where does the denser material begin?</mark> How does the composition differ from surface rocks?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Volcanic vents like Shiprock occasionally bring up pieces of Earth from as deep as 150 km, but these rocks are rare, and we have little hope of taking Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth. <mark class="ngss core-ideas">Instead, much of our knowledge about the internal structure of the Earth comes from remote observations – specifically, from observations of earthquakes</mark>.

                    <p>
                        Earthquakes can be extremely destructive for humans, but they provide a wealth of information about Earth's interior. <mark class="ngss crosscutting">This is because every earthquake sends out an array of seismic waves in all directions, similar to the way that throwing a stone into a pond sends out waves through the water. Observing the behavior of these seismic waves as they travel through the Earth gives us insight into the materials the waves move through</mark>.
