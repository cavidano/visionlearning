The distinction between these two <mark class="term" data-term-def="[noun] The motion of rising and falling in curves; undulation.">waves</mark> is easy to picture with a stretched-out Slinky®. If you push on one end, a compression wave passes through the Slinky® parallel to its length (see P-waves video). If instead you move one end up and down rapidly, a "ripple" wave moves through the Slinky® (see S-waves video). The compression waves are P-waves, and the ripple waves are S-waves.

                            Given Newton's observations, if we assume Earth's density increases evenly with depth because of the overlying pressure, wave velocity will also increase with depth and the waves will continuously refract, traveling along curved paths back towards the surface. Figure 1 shows the kind of pattern we would expect to see in this case. By the early 1900s, when seismographs were installed worldwide, it quickly became clear that Earth could not possibly be so simple.

                            As early as 132 CE, the Chinese had built instruments to measure the ground shaking associated with earthquakes. <mark class="ngss core-ideas" data-ngss-cat="Practices" data-ngss-desc="Planning and carrying out investigations: British seismologists teaching in Japan recognized the frequency of earthquakes and wanted to develop an instrument to more accurately record them.">The first modern seismographs, however, weren't built until the 1880s, when British seismologists in Japan designed them to record local earthquakes.</mark> It wasn't long before those seismologists recognized that they were also recording earthquakes occurring thousands of kilometers away.
