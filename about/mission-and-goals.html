    <h2>A new vision for teaching and learning science</h2>

    <p>
        The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) describe a new vision for teaching and learning science in the K-12 environment. That vision relies on the seamless integration of three dimensions: science and engineering practices (SEPs), cross-cutting concepts (CCs), and disciplinary core ideas (DCIs) (National Research Council, 2012). Instead of listing content that students should know, the NGSS articulate a set of performance expectations that ask students to apply practices to a core content idea and make connections to broad, cross-cutting concepts and their relevance to humans and society. 
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, a performance expectation at the middle-level asks students to "Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development of technologies to mitigate their effects" (NGSS Lead States, 2013). Simply learning about the multitude of natural hazards and their distribution around the world is not enough to help students achieve this performance expectation. Instead, students need to have repeated experiences where they are analyzing and interpreting real data about hazards, looking for patterns in hazard distribution and population, and using that information to ask new questions.
