                            <p>The Terms of Use, Copyright and Privacy constitute the entire agreement between you and Visionlearning and govern your use of the Service, superceding any prior agreements between you and Visionlearning. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. The Terms of Use and the relationship between you and Visionlearning shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Visionlearning agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Connecticut. The failure of Visionlearning to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Use, Copyright and Privacy remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the Terms of Use must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>
                            <p>You also permit any other user of Visionlearning to access, view, store and reproduce the User Content to the same extent permitted herein. Moreover, you acknowledge that any Content that is on or otherwise made available on Visionlearning that is not uploaded or otherwise made available by you is not yours and you do not have any ownership rights therein. Therefore, you warrant that you will not copy, publish, reproduce, modify or distribute such Content without the express permission of the owner in violation of US or other laws, including such laws relating to copyright, trade secrets and/or any other statutory or regulatory provisions.</p>
