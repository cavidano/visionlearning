- Title: 'Discovery and Structure of Cells'

  Summary: >
    Cells are the basic structural and functional unit of life. This module traces the discovery of the cell in the 1600s and the development of modern cell theory. The module looks at similarities and differences between different types of cells and the relationship between cell structure and function. The Theory of Universal Common Descent is presented along with evidence that all living things on Earth descended from a common ancestor.

- Title: 'Blood Biology I'

  Summary: >
    Knowledge of blood components brought about a revolution in surgery through safe transfusion. The module traces the development of our understanding of blood over centuries, beginning in 1628 with English physician William Harvey's breakthrough research on circulation. With a focus on early 20th-century experiments by Austrian researcher Karl Landsteiner, the module shows how the identification of clotting factors, blood types, and antigens was critical to medical science. Whole blood, plasma, serum, and different types of blood cells are defined.

- Title: 'César Milstein'

  Summary: >
    From home pregnancy tests to treatment for Ebola, the discovery of monoclonal antibodies has greatly advanced science and medicine. This module traces the work of immunologist César Milstein, who successfully created “hybridoma” cells capable of producing specific antibodies in mass quantities. The module describes Milstein’s life as a student in Argentina during the regime of Juan Peron and his later research as he became a world-class scientist, winning the Nobel Prize in 1984.

- Title: 'Energy Metabolism I'

  Summary: >
    Food fuels our bodies, but how does our body convert food molecules into usable energy? This module looks at glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, two important stages of cellular respiration, the process by which cells harvest energy from food. It highlights the work of Sir Hans Adolf Krebs and his focus on cyclic pathways as he discovered the main biochemical pathway for breaking down fuel to produce energy.

- Title: 'Energy Metabolism II'

  Summary: >
    ATP is the main energy currency of living cells. This module answers the question of how most ATP is generated. A look at two important compounds, NADH and FADH2, reveals their important role in the production of ATP. The module explains the workings of the electron transport chain, which provides high-energy electrons to fuel the ATP-producing process called oxidative phosphorylation.
