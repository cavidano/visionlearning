- Title: Moho

  Description: >
    This animation simulates what Andrija Mohorovičić observed in 1909 - that seismic waves travel faster in the mantle than they do in the crust because it is composed of denser material.

- Title: Atomic and ionic structure of the first 12 elements

  Description: >
    This animation provides the planetary and quantum view of the electron configuration for the first 12 elements on the periodic table. In addition, users can select a view of the nucleus of each atom and configuration of the major ion formed by the atom. Simply click on an element from the table above to proceed.

- Title: Bohr's Atom

  Description: >
    Neils Bohr proposed that electrons resided in specific orbitals within atoms in his groundbreaking work on atomic theory. This animation allows you to add different amounts of energy to see how the electron in a hydrogen atom responds, and then manually allow that electron to relax to specific orbitals within the atom.
