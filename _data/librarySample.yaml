          This module describes investigations into the origins of life through
          history, including Louis Pasteur’s experiments that disproved the
          long-held idea of spontaneous generation and and later research showing
          that the emergence of biological molecules from a nonliving environment
          – or abiogenesis – is not only possible, but likely under the right
          conditions.
      - Id: '227'
        Name: Origins of Life II
        Summary: >

          uncover and evaluate clues to the lineage to modern humans, tracing
          intermediate forms along the way since the time we diverged from our
          cousins, the great apes. Key discoveries are highlighted that shed light
          on the pathway of human evolution. The module describes different ideas
          through history about how the human family tree is constructed and which
          characteristics best define humanness.
      - Id: '259'
        Name: Future of Human Evolution
        Summary: >
          Some noted modern scientists have declared that human evolution is over.
          With advances in medicine and public health, natural selection is no
          longer a major shaping force for humans. Even so, it doesn’t mean that
          humans won’t evolve. This module explores the various directions that
          human evolution might take. Various influences on human evolution are
          discussed by way of specific examples, including artificial selection
          through surgical advances and how “bottlenecking” could affect the human
          gene pool if distant space colonies are formed in the future.
      - Id: '263'
        Name: The Piltdown Hoax
        Summary: >
          The Piltdown Man was once hailed as the "missing link" in the evolution
          of apes to humans. However, the discovery at Piltdown - human skull
          fragments, ancient mammal bones, and archaic tools - was an elaborate
          hoax. The deception took a long time to be revealed due to errors by the
          discoverers. They succumbed to confirmation bias by accepting any
          evidence that supported their discovery and rejecting any contradictory
          evidence.

        Summary: >
          When it comes to different liquids, some mix well while others don’t;
          some pour quickly while others flow slowly. This module provides a
          foundation for considering states of matter in all their complexity. It
          explains the basic properties of liquids, and explores how
          intermolecular forces determine their behavior. The concepts of
          cohesion, adhesion, and viscosity are defined. The module also examines
          how temperature and molecule size and type affect the properties of
          liquids.

        Name: Properties of Gases
        Summary: >
          This module describes the properties of gases and explores how these
          properties relate to a common set of behaviors called the gas laws. With
          a focus on Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and Avogadro’s Law, an overview
          of 400 years of research shows the development of our understanding of
          gas behavior. The module presents the ideal gas equation and explains
          when this equation can—and cannot—be used to predict the behavior of
          real gases.

        Name: Diffusion I
        Summary: >
          The process of diffusion is critical to life, as it is necessary when
          our lungs exchange gas during breathing and when our cells take in
          nutrients. This module explains diffusion and describes factors that
          influence the process. The module looks at historical developments in
          our understanding of diffusion, from observations of “dancing” particles
          in the first century BCE to the discovery of Brownian motion to more
          recent experiments. Topics include concentration gradients, the
          diffusion coefficient, and advection.

        Name: Kinetic-Molecular Theory
        Summary: >
          Over four hundred years, scientists including Rudolf Clausius and James
          Clerk Maxwell developed the kinetic-molecular theory (KMT) of gases,
          which describes how molecule properties relate to the macroscopic
          behaviors of an ideal gas—a theoretical gas that always obeys the ideal
          gas equation. KMT provides assumptions about molecule behavior that can
          be used both as the basis for other theories about molecules and to
          solve real-world problems.

        Name: Solutions, Solubility, and Colligative Properties
        Summary: >
          Aqueous solutions are found throughout our world, and their chemistry
          depends in part on how much of a dissolved substance is in them. This
          module explores how substances dissolve, why some substances don’t
          dissolve, and how we express the concentration of a solution. The module
          describes the forces that hold particles together and interactions that
          keep dissolved particles apart. It also examines how concentration
          affects freezing point, boiling point, and vapor pressure.

        Name: Water
        Summary: >
          Water is a truly unusual and important substance. The unique chemical
          properties of water that give rise to surface tension, capillary action,
          and the low density of ice play vital roles in life as we know it.
          Floating ice protects aquatic organisms and keeps them from being frozen
          in the winter. Capillary action keeps plants alive. Surface tension
          allows lily pads to stay on the surface of a lake. In fact, water’s
          chemistry is so complex and important that scientists today are still
          striving to understand all the feats this simple substance can perform.

        Name: Chemical Reactions
        Summary: >
          This modules explores the variety of chemical reactions by grouping them
          into general types. We look at synthesis, decomposition, single
          replacement, double replacement, REDOX (including combustion), and
          acid-base reactions, with examples of each.

        Name: Nuclear Chemistry
        Summary: >
          Beginning with the work of Marie Curie and others, this module traces
          the development of nuclear chemistry. It describes different types of
          radiation: alpha, beta, and gamma. The module then applies the principle
          of half-life to radioactive decay and explains the difference between
          nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.

        Name: Carbon Chemistry
        Summary: >
          The chemical basis of all living organisms is linked to the way that
          carbon bonds with other atoms. This introduction to organic chemistry
          explains the many ways that carbon and hydrogen form bonds. Basic
          hydrocarbon nomenclature is described, including alkanes, alkenes,
          alkynes, and isomers. Functional groups of atoms within organic
          molecules are discussed.
