  Description: >
    Life as we know it is a wonderfully diverse enterprise. Organisms pass
    traits from parent to offspring, function in a varied and changing
    environment, and carry out a myriad of complex biochemical processes.
    Understanding the principles of biology helps give context and clarity to
    larger scientific and social issues. Our biology learning modules reveal the
    current state of scientific understanding on topics like cell structure and
    function, genetics, taxonomy, evolution by natural selection, and more.

      - Id: '198'
        Name: Membranes I
        Summary: >
          Cell membranes are much more than passive barriers; they are complex and
          dynamic structures that control what enters and leaves the cell. This
          module explores how scientists came to understand cell membranes,
          including the experiments that led to the development of the
          fluid-mosaic model of membrane structure. The module describes how the
          components and structure of cell membranes relate to key functions.

      - Id: '204'
        Name: Membranes II
        Summary: >
          For living things to survive, different molecules need to enter and
          leave cells, yet cell membranes serve as a barrier to most molecules.
          Fortunately, all living cells have built-in transporters that allow
          water, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, and other molecules to
          cross the plasma membrane. This module looks at how passive and active
          transporters work. It highlights the importance of the study of cell
          membranes by looking at advances in treating cystic fibrosis and common
          digestive ailments as well as the development of effective pain
          relievers.

      - Id: '195'
        Name: Cellular Organelles I
        Summary: >
          Evolution isn't always about competition. It can also be about
          cooperation, as is the case with the development of chloroplasts and
          mitochondria from free-living bacteria. This module explains the theory
          of endosymbiosis along with its origins. Convincing evidence in support
          of the theory is presented. The evolution of the nucleus and other
          organelles through  invagination of the cell membrane is also discussed.

      - Id: '106'
        Name: Absorption, Distribution, and Storage of Chemicals
        Summary: >
          In order for many medicines to work, the chemicals must move from the
          outside environment into the body. This module discusses the different
          mechanisms by which chemicals cross the cell membrane and the factors
          that influence this process. In addition to introducing biological
          absorption, the module explains how chemicals are stored and distributed
          within the body.

        Name: Origins of Life I
        Summary: >
          Since prehistoric times, people have pondered how life came to exist.
          This module describes investigations into the origins of life through
          history, including Louis Pasteur’s experiments that disproved the
          long-held idea of spontaneous generation and and later research showing
          that the emergence of biological molecules from a nonliving environment
          – or abiogenesis – is not only possible, but likely under the right
          conditions.
      - Id: '227'
        Name: Origins of Life II
        Summary: >
          Building on earlier experiments showing how life’s chemical building
          blocks could form from nonliving material on early Earth, this module
          explores theories on the next steps needed for life. These include the
          formation of long polymers, which then fold into complex macromolecules.
          The module describes experiments in an environment like that of
          primordial Earth, resulting in the spontaneous emergence of
          phospholipids, which could form into membranes, paving the way for RNA
          duplication and the eventual emergence of living cells.
      - Id: '110'
        Name: Charles Darwin I
        Summary: >
          The experiences and observations of Charles Darwin significantly
          contributed to his theory of evolution through natural selection. This
          module explores those influences and describes evolution as a force for
          biological change and diversification. The first in a series, it details
          how the theory challenged the cultural mindset of the time, including
          the effect of his major works: <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of
          Natural Selection</em> and <em>Sexual Selection and the Descent of
          Man.</em>

      - Id: '111'
        Name: Charles Darwin II
        Summary: >
          The second in a series discussing the work of Charles Darwin, this
          module takes a deeper look into the processes that led to Darwin's
          theory of natural selection and examines specific mechanisms that drive
          evolutionary change. Key points on which the idea of natural selection
          rests are outlined. Examples from Darwin's personal life shed light on
          his thinking about change within a species and the "struggle for
          existence."

      - Id: '112'
        Name: Charles Darwin III
        Summary: >
          Our understanding of the term <em>evolution</em> has changed
          significantly since Darwin's time. This module explains how Darwin's
          work helped to give evolution the meaning it has today. It details the
          concept of "descent with modification" that Darwin described with the
          one figure originally included in <em>Origin of Species</em>. The module
          discusses how this model revolutionized scientific thinking about the
          similarities and differences between and within species, laying the
          foundation for our current understanding of biodiversity.

        Name: Adaptation
        Summary: >
          This module introduces the concept of evolutionary adaptation. It
          follows the development of Charles Darwin's ideas on how species adapt
          to their environment in order to survive and reproduce. The difference
          between adaptation and natural selection is explained. With a look at
          penguins and other examples from nature, the module explores the
          processes that influence the diversity of life.
      - Id: '89'
        Name: Taxonomy II
        Summary: >
          Carolus Linnaeus, the “father of taxonomy,” developed a uniform system
          for naming plants and animals to ensure that each species has a unique
          name. This module outlines rules of forming two-term taxonomic names
          according to genus and species. The module gives examples of naming
          controversies and describes how they were resolved, including by bending
          the rules in regard to certain famous beasts.

        Name: Taxonomy I
        Summary: >
          Modern taxonomy officially began in 1758 with <em>Systema Naturae</em>,
          the classic work by Carolus Linnaeus. This module, the first in a
          two-part series on species taxonomy, focuses on Linnaeus’ system for
          classifying and naming plants and animals. The module discusses the
          contribution of diverse cultures to the development of our modern
          biological classification and describes the historical development of a
          scientific basis for classifying species.

      - Id: '258'
        Name: Introduction to Paleoanthropology
        Summary: >
          Paleoanthropology is the study of human ancestry through fossil remains
          and other evidence. This module explains how paleoanthropologists
          uncover and evaluate clues to the lineage to modern humans, tracing
          intermediate forms along the way since the time we diverged from our
          cousins, the great apes. Key discoveries are highlighted that shed light
          on the pathway of human evolution. The module describes different ideas
          through history about how the human family tree is constructed and which
          characteristics best define humanness.
      - Id: '259'
        Name: Future of Human Evolution
        Summary: >
          Some noted modern scientists have declared that human evolution is over.
          With advances in medicine and public health, natural selection is no
          longer a major shaping force for humans. Even so, it doesn’t mean that
          humans won’t evolve. This module explores the various directions that
          human evolution might take. Various influences on human evolution are
          discussed by way of specific examples, including artificial selection
          through surgical advances and how “bottlenecking” could affect the human
          gene pool if distant space colonies are formed in the future.
      - Id: '263'
        Name: The Piltdown Hoax
        Summary: >
          The Piltdown Man was once hailed as the "missing link" in the evolution
          of apes to humans. However, the discovery at Piltdown - human skull
          fragments, ancient mammal bones, and archaic tools - was an elaborate
          hoax. The deception took a long time to be revealed due to errors by the
          discoverers. They succumbed to confirmation bias by accepting any
          evidence that supported their discovery and rejecting any contradictory
          evidence.
