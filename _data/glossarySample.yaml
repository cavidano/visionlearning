        Since prehistoric times, people have pondered how life came to exist.
        This module describes investigations into the origins of life through
        history, including Louis Pasteur’s experiments that disproved the
        long-held idea of spontaneous generation and and later research showing
        that the emergence of biological molecules from a nonliving environment
        – or abiogenesis – is not only possible, but likely under the right
        conditions.

      Name: Origins of Life II
      Summary: >-
        Building on earlier experiments showing how life’s chemical building
        blocks could form from nonliving material on early Earth, this module
        explores theories on the next steps needed for life. These include the
        formation of long polymers, which then fold into complex macromolecules.
        The module describes experiments in an environment like that of
        primordial Earth, resulting in the spontaneous emergence of
        phospholipids, which could form into membranes, paving the way for RNA
        duplication and the eventual emergence of living cells.

      Name: Kinetic-Molecular Theory
      Summary: >-
        Over four hundred years, scientists including Rudolf Clausius and James
        Clerk Maxwell developed the kinetic-molecular theory (KMT) of gases,
        which describes how molecule properties relate to the macroscopic
        behaviors of an ideal gas—a theoretical gas that always obeys the ideal
        gas equation. KMT provides assumptions about molecule behavior that can
        be used both as the basis for other theories about molecules and to
        solve real-world problems.

      Name: Properties of Gases
      Summary: >-
        This module describes the properties of gases and explores how these
        properties relate to a common set of behaviors called the gas laws. With
        a focus on Boyle’s Law, Charles’s Law, and Avogadro’s Law, an overview
        of 400 years of research shows the development of our understanding of
        gas behavior. The module presents the ideal gas equation and explains
        when this equation can—and cannot—be used to predict the behavior of
        real gases.

  Name: acceleration
  Definition: "The change in an object's velocity over time, measured in distance per unit time per unit time (for example meters per second per second or m/s<sup>2</sup>). Compare to <a href=\"http://www.visionlearning.com/en/glossary/index/V#term-5594\">velocity</a>. Acceleration (a) is calculated by dividing the change (symbolized by &#916;, the Greek letter delta) in velocity (v) by the change in time (t):\r<br>\n\r<br>\na = &#916;v/ &#916;t.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis can also be written as: \r<br>\n\r<br>\na = v<sub>2</sub>-v<sub>1</sub>/ t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>1</sub>, where v<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>1</sub> denote the starting velocity and time and v<sub>2</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> denote the ending velocity and time.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nTo illustrate, imagine a car speeding up (accelerating) from a stand still (0 meters/second) to a speed of 15 meters/seconds over the course of 5 seconds. The car's total increase in velocity is 15 meters/second.  During each of the 5 seconds that the car is accelerating, its velocity increases by 3 meters/second until it reaches its top speed. (After one second the car is traveling at a velocity of 3 meters/second; after 2 seconds, it's traveling at a velocity of 6 meters/second, and so on). Therefore, the car's rate of acceleration is 3 meters per second per second or 3 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Using the equation above:\r<br>\n\r<br>\na = v<sub>2</sub>-v<sub>1</sub>/ t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>1</sub>\r<br>\na = 15-0 / 5-0\r<br>\na = 15/5\r<br>\na = 3 m/s<sup>2</sup>"

        whole. This module explains what scientists mean when they refer to the
        scientific literature and offers specific examples of how scientists use
        it to (1) discover what other work has been done on a topic, (2) cite
        sources of their data, and (3) show how their interpretations relate to
        existing knowledge.

      Name: Future of Human Evolution
      Summary: >-
        Some noted modern scientists have declared that human evolution is over.
        With advances in medicine and public health, natural selection is no
        longer a major shaping force for humans. Even so, it doesn’t mean that
        humans won’t evolve. This module explores the various directions that
        human evolution might take. Various influences on human evolution are
        discussed by way of specific examples, including artificial selection
        through surgical advances and how “bottlenecking” could affect the human
        gene pool if distant space colonies are formed in the future.

      Summary: >-
        Inheritance patterns have been of interest since ancient times, but it
        was Gregor Mendel's work in the mid-1800s that confirmed that traits are
        passed on by two parents in a predictable pattern. This module describes
        the experiments that resulted in <em>Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</em>.
        A look at specific traits in pea plants over generations shows how
        Mendel's research methods resulted in an understanding of dominant and
        recessive genes. Partial dominance is also discussed.

        certain traits and diseases within the population. Beginning with a look
        at the abnormally high rate of a dangerous health condition in US Amish
        communities, this module explores forces that affect a population's gene
        pool. Among them are natural selection, gene flow, and two types of
        genetic drift: founder effects and bottleneck events. The
        Harvey-Weinberg Equilibrium equation is presented along with sample
        problems that show how to calculate the frequency of specific alleles in
        a population.

        This module introduces haplotypes – genetic sequences that we inherit
        from only one parent. As an example, the module looks at the degree of
        interbreeding between now-extinct Neanderthals and modern humans as
        determined through an analysis of Y-chromosome haplotypes (male lineage)
        and mitochondrial DNA haplotypes (female lineage).

        with cathode ray tubes that led to the discovery of the first subatomic
        particle: the electron. The module then describes Thomson’s plum pudding
        model of the atom along with Rutherford’s gold foil experiment that
        resulted in the nuclear model of the atom. Also explained is Millikan’s
        oil drop experiment, which allowed him to determine an electron’s
        charge. Readers will see how the work of many scientists was critical in
        this period of rapid development in atomic theory.

        application of quantum theory and waves to the behavior of electrons.
        With a focus on Bohr’s work, the developments explored in this module
        were based on the advancements of many scientists over time and laid the
        groundwork for future scientists to build upon further. The module also
        describes James Chadwick’s discovery of the neutron. Among other topics

  Name: alternative hypothesis
  Definition: >-
    In statistical testing, an alternative hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is a
    statement describing the possibility that an observed result or effect is
    genuine. The alternative hypothesis is always compared to a null hypothesis
    (H<sub>0</sub>), and H<sub>1</sub> is not accepted until statistical testing
    shows that it should be accepted in favor of H<sub>0</sub>. For example, in
    an evaluation of data regarding the pain relieving properties of a new drug,
    the alternative hypothesis would state that the new drug has an effect on
    pain relief compared to a control. Accepting H<sub>1</sub> does not indicate
    that the observed result or effect is large or important, simply that it is
    favored in terms of probability of the outcome.

      Summary: >-
        Many techniques have been developed to aid scientists in making sense of
        their data. This module explores inferential statistics, an invaluable
        tool that helps scientists uncover patterns and relationships in a
        dataset, make judgments about data, and apply observations about a
        smaller set of data to a much larger group. The module explains the
        importance of random sampling to avoid bias. Other concepts include
        populations, subsamples, estimation, and the difference between a
        parameter and a statistic.

        Inheritance patterns have been of interest since ancient times, but it
        was Gregor Mendel's work in the mid-1800s that confirmed that traits are
        passed on by two parents in a predictable pattern. This module describes
        the experiments that resulted in <em>Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</em>.
        A look at specific traits in pea plants over generations shows how
        Mendel's research methods resulted in an understanding of dominant and
        recessive genes. Partial dominance is also discussed.
